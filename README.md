COVID- 19 UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS IN INDIA

Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so in this project i am analyzing the unemployment rate.

Having done EDA on the data set, I found out that the northern regions of India seemed to have more unemployed people, Haryana and Jharkhand having the highest numbers.
